OVERVIEW:

 This program takes in data from a CSV file and interacts with it based off
 user input. The data is a collection of values, and percents that represent facts such as
 population estimation, Veterans (2014 - 2018) etc.. 


INCLUDED FILES:

 * CensusActions.java - source file
 * Census.java - source file
 * README - this file
 * IdahoCensusInfo.csv - source file


COMPILING AND RUNNING:

 From the directory containing all source files, compile the
 driver class (and all dependencies) with the command:
 $ javac Census.java

 Run the compiled class file with the command:
 $ java Census.java

 Console output will give the results after the program finishes.


PROGRAM DESIGN AND IMPORTANT CONCEPTS:

 Explain the main concepts and organization of your program so that
 the reader can understand how your program works. This is not a repeat
 of javadoc comments or an exhaustive listing of all methods, but an
 explanation of the critical algorithms and object interactions that make
 up the program.

 If your program has multiple classes, explain the main responsibilities 
 of each class. Explain how the classes work together to achieve the
 program goals. If there are important interfaces, explain their roles
 as well.
 
 If you were responsible for designing the program's classes and choosing
 how they work together, why did you design the program this way? What, if 
 anything, could be improved? 

 This is the sort of information someone who really wants to
 understand your program - possibly to make future enhancements -
 would want to know.

TESTING:

 How did you test your program to be sure it works and meets all of the
 requirements? Can your program handle bad input? Is your program 
 idiot-proof? How do you know? What are the known issues / bugs
 remaining in your program?


DISCUSSION:
 
 Discuss the issues you encountered during programming (development)
 and testing. What problems did you have? What did you have to research
 and learn on your own? What kinds of errors did you get? How did you 
 fix them?
 
 What parts of the project did you find challenging? Is there anything
 that finally "clicked" for you in the process of working on this project?
 
 
EXTRA CREDIT:

 If the project had opportunities for extra credit that you attempted,
 be sure to call it out so the grader does not overlook it.

All content in a README file is expected to be written in clear English with

be sure to get someone else to help you with proofreading. Consider all project
documentation to be professional writing for your boss and/or potential
customers.
